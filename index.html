        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          <em>Dungeons and Cats</em> in this feline-friendly adaptation of
          <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>, is a tabletop role-playing game (RPG)
          where you and your friends take on the roles of adventurous cats in a
          magical and mysterious world. Instead of traditional hero characters,
          you'll be embodying the lives of whiskered wonders, each with their
          own unique talents and personalities.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The game is guided by a Dungeon Master, who acts as the storyteller
          and referee. The world of Dungeons & Cats is filled with ancient
          ruins, hidden treasures, and a plethora of bizarre creatures to
          encounter. Your group of cat adventurers will embark on epic quests,
          explore dungeons, and face a variety of challenges, all with a feline
          twist.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Here's a basic overview of how the game works:</p>
        <p>
          It is a role playing game, played using mainly dice, some sheets of
          paper and the threatre of mind, with optional accessories to help
          facilitate the gameplay, such as a map, figurines, Dungeon Master
          screen to hide his machinations behind and more.
        </p>
        <br>
        <ol class="role-list">
          <li>
            Character Creation: Each player creates their own cat character,
            choosing from different breeds like tabby, Siamese, Maine Coon, or
            even rare mythical breeds like the Sphinx Cat. You also select a
            class that represents your cat's unique abilities, such as the
            "Pounce Mage" or the "Stealthy Rogue."
          </li>

          <li>
            Attributes: Cats in Dungeons & Cats have their own set of
            attributes, like Agility, Stealth, and Curiosity. These attributes
            determine your cat's prowess in various situations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dice Rolling: The game utilizes various types of dice, with the
            20-sided die (d20) being the most crucial. You roll dice to
            determine the outcome of your cat's actions, whether it's a daring
            leap across a chasm, a successful pounce on a pesky rat, or a
            stealthy approach to a sleeping giant.
          </li>
          <li>
            Quests and Adventures: The Dungeon Master weaves a story and
            presents quests for your group of cats to complete. These quests
            might involve rescuing a fellow cat from an evil wizard's tower,
            finding a legendary ball of yarn, or thwarting the plans of a
            power-hungry dog.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combat and Challenges: When your cats encounter dangers, they engage
            in combat using their unique abilities and dice rolls. You'll
            pounce, scratch, and hiss your way to victory.
          </li>
          <li>
            Role-Playing: A significant part of the game is the role-playing
            aspect. Players speak and make decisions as their cats would, using
            their feline instincts and personalities to solve problems and
            interact with other creatures.
          </li>
          <li>
            Character Advancement: As your cats complete quests and overcome
            challenges, they gain experience points and level up. This allows
            them to acquire new abilities and improve their existing ones.
          </li>
          <li>
            World Exploration: The Dungeons & Cats world is full of mysteries,
            and exploring the vast and imaginative landscape is a core part of
            the game. You might uncover hidden catnip gardens, ancient
            scratching posts, or even a portal to the mythical "Land of Eternal
            Sunbeams."
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p>Dungeons & Cats is a delightful and imaginative twist on the classic
          Dungeons & Dragons, offering players a purrfectly unique
          role-playing experience that will have you and your friends purring
          with excitement as you embark on epic adventures in a world where
          cats rule the roost!</p>

          He summon many things, great things, a lot of things, and has access
          to a wide variety of spells, of which you use exactly one all the

        <p>
          Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the
          spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates
          the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning,
          subtle deception, and brute-force mind control.

        <p>
          Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through
          words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds,
          create illusions, and even heal wounds. The bard is a master of song,
          speech, and the magic they contain.

        <img src="img/druidcat.png" height="300" width="300" alt="Druid Cat">
        <p>
          Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the
          creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature's
          resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature, but
          see themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will.

        <img src="img/barbariancat.jpg" height="300" width="300" alt="Barbarian Cat">
        <p>
          For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal
          spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full
          of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a
          battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of
          strength.

        <img src="img/paladincat.png" height="300" width="300" alt="Paladin Cat">
        <p>
          Whether sworn before a god's altar and the witness of a priest, in a
          sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of
          desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin's
          oath is a powerful bond.

        <h3>Sorcerer &#x1FA84;</h3>
        <img src="img/sorcerercat.jpg" height="300" width="300" alt="Sorcerer Cat">
        <p>
          Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic
          bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic
          forces. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.

        <h3>Cleric &#x271D;</h3>
        <img src="img/clericcat.jpg" height="300" width="300" alt="Cleric Cat">
        <p>
          Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant
          planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive
          to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric
          is imbued with divine magic.

        <img src="img/artificercat.jpg" height="300" width="300" alt="Science Cat">
        <p>
          Masters of invention, artificers use ingenuity and magic to unlock
          extraordinary capabilities in objects. They see magic as a complex
          system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells and
          inventions.

        <img src="img/fightercat.jpg" height="300" width="300" alt="Fighter Cat">
        <p>
          Fighters share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a
          thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. They are well acquainted
          with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h3>Monk &#x1F4FF;</h3>
        <img src="img/monkcat.jpg" height="300" width="300" alt="Monk Cat">
        <p>
          Monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that
          flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of
          combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this
          energy infuses all that a monk does.
        </p>

        <h3>Rogue &#x1F977;</h3>
        <img src="img/roguecat.jpg" height="300" width="300" alt="Rogue Cat">
        <p>
          Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get
          the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the
          solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness
          and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring
          party.

        <p>
          Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter
          the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the
          dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty
          plains, rangers keep their unending watch.
